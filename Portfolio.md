<h3> Bio </h3> 

Currently I am a second-year student at Brock University majoring in Interactive Arts and Science. Within Interactive Arts and Science and digital humanities my specific areas of interest would be data visualisation, media archaeology, cultural studies. My existing projects are a reflection of my areas of interest because for my solo presentation I choose to speak on the Nintendo Virtual boy and what happened to the produce and why it failed and then compared and contrasted the virtual boy to Virtual Reality in 2019 which allowed me to explore my interest of media archaeology. In the future I would like to explore my interests of be data visualisation, media archaeology, cultural studies as I feel I have just dipped my toes into learning about the subjects and I am excited to see where they can lead in the future.

Introduce the work 
For my Research project (Solo presentation) I choose to cover the Nintendo Virtual Boy and why the product ultimately failed, what has changed since its release, how technology and the markets have changed and what modern Virtual Reality is like compared to the Virtual Boy. Covering the Virtual boy allowed me to peer into how Data Visualisation works and how it has evolved through the years. I was able to view this though my research of the virtual boy as data and research on the topic was very scarce and limited. When compared to when I was researching Virtual Reality the contrast of content allowed me to view how data visualisation, media archaeology and cultural studies in the digital humanities have evolved over the years. In my research comparing the Nintendo Virtual Boy I was able to see how the virtual boy has actually been use as a framework for the base design of modern Virtual Reality.

<h3> Academic Blog Post </h3>  

Prompt: 
Ramsay and Drucker's critique of Moretti should be taken to heart by digital humanists: any reliance on externally-produced data sets should be abolished in the field. Instead, each digital humanist will show the interpretive methods used to produce their unique data sets, and no two scholars will ever use the same data to conduct their research. Doing so will allow digital scholarship to fully embrace its humanities background, foregrounding subjective experience above all else. Established datasets are for scientists, and they have no place in humanities research. All data should be interpretively created

Overall, I feel that Ramsay and Drucker’s critique of Moretti have some interesting points. I do feel as there are things that I disagree with and some points that I can agree with when it comes to limiting the data sets for digital humanist.
Disagree 
  I personally disagree with several points of Ramsey and Drucker’s critique of Moretti.  The first of which is that reliance on externally-produced data sets should be abolished in the field. If externally-produced data sets were abolished in the digital humanities field, it would vastly limit the amount of studies that are available to digital humanities.  The digital humanities field is constantly changing making it very difficult to keep a steady flow of data sets that are only produced by the digital humanities field. Limiting the data sets would make this more difficult.  Also, the digital humanists field has many aspects that cross over into the sciences and basic humanities; therefore, being able to access studies made by other fields would allow for more thorough and less biased studies in all areas of study.  
Secondly, I also disagree with the idea that no two scholars will ever use the same data set, as this will encourage biased research and can limit possible cross references for more through research. Although the idea of encouraging unique data sets is not terrible since the digital humanities are evolving almost daily. Having no two scholars use the same data set will lead to more problems than it would solve. For example, it is more likely for data to become more biased if it is only being used by one scholar, where as if the same data was used by multiple Scholars it would allow for a more through examination, diverse studies and conclusions. 
Finally, I also strongly disagree with the idea that established data sets are only for scientists; as in life, everything needs a baseline in order to be explained. I can understand that the reliance on established data sets can cripple some studies in the digital humanities since the data can be outdated.  However, having established data sets can be beneficial in studying digital humanities. The problem that the digital humanities run into is that data can no longer be correct as the field is always changing and evolving, but this can also be the case in any other field like the sciences. Even though new studies may reveal new facts about the sciences they still use the same established data sets in the scientific field; it is the data collector’s responsibility to see if the data is in check and up to appropriate standards. If the digital humanities had an established data set this would allow for the digital humanist to access data at a faster rate since they are not having to collect unique data every time, they want to conduct a study. Therefore, increasing the amount of digital humanities studies that can be conducted and published. 
Agree 
I do agree with one of idea Ramsey and Drucker’s ideas which is to have each digital humanist show the interpretive methods used to produce their unique data sets. If each digital humanist shows the interpretive methods used to produce their unique data sets it will easily allow other digital humanist to look at how the data was produced. This analysis will then allow the digital humanist to replicate the data, to test for similar results or allow other scholars to look for similar patterns within their own studies and to check for possible cross over. Having each digital humanist show the interpretive methods used to produce their data sets will allow studies of the digital huminites to be more diverse and have data that is relevant in an ever changing and evolving field. 

 This text analysis was taken from Reading Machines by Stephen Ramsay; in every paragraph that mentioned Moretti and his studies (Figure 1). Looking at the analysis we can see that Ramsay heavily uses specific words in the paragraphs when he focuses on Moretti and his work; this is indicated by the size of the word.  The largest word is “interpretation” as when Ramsey speaks about Moretti and his work, he focuses on interpretation in the humanities. Ramsay disagrees with Moretti as he believes that “quantitative data are useful because they are independent of interpretation; then, that they are challenging because they often demand an interpretation that transcends the quantitative realm” (Ramsay, 5). Where as Moretti believes that quantitative data can be used and interpreted. If we compare the text of Figure 1 (Moretti only mentioned paragraphs in Reading Machines by Stephen Ramsay) and Figure 2 (full text of Reading Machines by Stephen Ramsay) Figure 1 focuses more on text and the interpretation of it, whereas Figure 2 focuses more on the analysis of text and how it can be studied.
